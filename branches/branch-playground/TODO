		- in Mainwindow
			* Onlinebar (vertical drawing)
			* weathertoolbar (is on top and transparent, anyhow, and crashing when move attempt)
	* OSD is black in win32
	* Buttons, no Text on it (soundplugin f.e.)
	* Datepicker does not work and is not displayed right (popup) at QCursor::pos())
	* Floatys are not as long as in 0.9.5
	* dragging files on Kontakt in contact list is not possible to send them via filetransfer, but works with floatys
	* sound-plugin event-tab: the path lines are not display right, also the play/browse buttons are shrinked ;)

- Sound-plugin:
	* no startup sound is played
