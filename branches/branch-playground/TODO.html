0.9.6 Todo:



- Config:
	<s>- On startup all seems initialized by 0.9.6, the 0.9.5-config gets broken due to this initialization</s> <font>Fixed by Denis</font>

- GUI-Problems:
	* Fix all toolbars:
		- CToolButtons don't have Highlight-Effect anymore
			* popup in at QCursor::pos() does not work
		- Interfacetoolbars:
			- Middle-toolbar:
				- some Buttons are broken on the left (color button)
				- some controls should be hidden in toolbar as in 0.9.5, show only the needed ones. (Restoration of the Toolbar/Container behavior)
				- shrinked toolbar (small container width): the ">>" is shown, but has no function on the right of the toolbar
				<s>- Smilie-Window</s> <font>Fixed by Yury</font>
					<s>- is not hiding clicking in container</s> <font>Fixed by Yury</font>
					<s>- is opened multiple times if multiple times is clicked on the smilie button</s> <font>Fixed by Yury</font>
			- Menu:
				- on the left is a second "Ignore"-Button without functionality, which should be removed.
		- in Mainwindow
			* Onlinebar
				- Position Saving
				<s>- vertical OnlineToolbar: Width is much to big. Seems to the width from StatusButton.</s> <font>Fixed by Denis</font>
				<s>- vertical expanding of StatusButton where Statustext is displayed</s> <font>Fixed by Noragen</font>
				<s>- vertical Online Statustext drawing</s> <font>Fixed by Yury</font>
			* weathertoolbar
				- Icons are not shown in Tooltip

				<s>- is on top (should be displayed at bottom)</s> <font>Fixed by Christian</font>
				<s>- transparent</s> <font>Fixed by Christian</font>

		- HistoryToolbar:
			- Searchbutton not displayed/messed up
			- horizontal expanding of the controls does not work.
			- History direction cannot be reverted with click on the corresponding arrow-Button

	* Setup: Buttons, no Text on it (soundplugin f.e.)
	* Floatys are not as long as in 0.9.5
	* dragging files on contakt in contactlist is not possible to send them via filetransfer, but works with floatys
	* sound-plugin event-tab: the path lines are not display right, also the play/browse buttons are shrinked ;)
	* Container/History: no context-menu on right click
	* Search/Add-Dialog:
		- Labels for Textfields are missing.
		- Functiontest has to be done.
	* Online-Tooltips of contact list are hanging sometimes, they don't disappear
	<s>* OSD is black in win32</s> <font>Fixed by Noragen</font>
	<s>* OSD fading in win32</s> <font>Fixed by Noragen</font>
	<s>* Search/Add-Dialog broken. Crashing on open</s> <font>Fixed by Christian</font>
	<s>* Datepicker does not work and is not displayed right (popup) at QCursor::pos())</s> <font>Fixed by Christian</font>

- Sound-plugin:
	* no startup sound is played

- Config/Setup-Window steals access to other windows (f.e. no possible acces to InterfaceWindow, MainWindow.. then.)
- Filetransfer-Window steals access to other windows, too

- Search:
	- after Clicking around: UIN-Field is not longer enabled, when clicking on UIN-Checkbox
	<s>- Search ICQ:</s> <font>Partly Fixed by Yury</font>
	* Search Jabber:
		- Labels are broken

- Translation: broken
- Test and fix "Change Profile" for working stable and secure

- ConfigStorage:
	- Some Settings are saved in Registry in Win32 (QSettings?), this is a bad idea, if Sim-IM should be run on Computers with restricted access to registry f.e. it can't be written.
	  using %appdata%\sim for global .conf is better.
